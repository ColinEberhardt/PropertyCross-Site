Developers are now finding themselves having to author applications for a diverse range of mobile platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, ...), each of which have their own 'native' development languages, tools and environment.

There is an ever growing list of cross-platform frameworks that allow you to minimise the cost and effort of developing mobile apps, but which to choose?

To help solve this problem PropertyCross presents a non-trivial application, for searching UK property listings, developed using a range of cross-platform technologies and frameworks. Our aim is to provide developers with a practical insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each framework.

This project is part of [TasteJS](http://tastejs.com), which also includes [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) - a project that helps developers compare JavaScript frameworks.
