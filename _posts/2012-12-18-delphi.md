Embarcadero Delphi is an integrated development environment for developing applications across a range of platforms. Applications are written using [Object Pascal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) and the [FireMonkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey) UI framework. The latest release of Delphi XE4 is the first release of FireMonkey that supports mobile application development for the iOS platfom. Android support is currently in development.

Delphi applications are written using the Delphi XE IDE which has a graphical UI editor for iOS applications. Compilation requires a Mac computer with Xcode, with the Delphi IDE communication to the Mac via 'PAServer'. Applications written using Delphi present a fully native user interface.
