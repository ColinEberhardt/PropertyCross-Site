Embarcadero Delphi is an integrated development environment for developing applications across a range of platforms. Applications are written using [Object Pascal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) and the [FireMonkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey) UI framework. The latest release of Delphi XE5 supports mobile development on both iOS and Android, as well as desktop platforms. 

Delphi applications are written using the Delphi XE5 IDE which has a graphical UI editor for mobile applications. Deployment to iOS requires tcp access to a Mac with the Xcode command-line tools, with the Delphi IDE communicating to the Mac via a 'PAServer' agent. Deployment to Android can all be done from Windows. Applications written using Delphi present a fully native user interface.
