This is an implementation of the PropertyCross application using [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) (v0.9.24).  Ionic is an HTML5 framework built with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and optimized for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) that uses [Cordova / PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) to package the HTML / JavaScript within a native wrapper for app-store deployment.  Ionic includes a mobile-specific components and controllers, and Cordova provides a set of APIs for accessing native phone functionalities which are not available via HTML specifications.

All HTML and JavaScript is shared across all mobile platforms, though small elements of functionality have been included to tailor the view subtly towards specific platforms.  View, controller, model and services code is developed and separated following AngularJS' standard approach.  Ionic provides an [npm](http://www.npmjs.org) package to create, build and run applications (using Cordova under the covers).
