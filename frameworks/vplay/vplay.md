[V-Play](http://v-play.net) is a cross-platform development framework for creating mobile games and apps. Based on the _Qt framework_, V-Play provides native performance and appearance on all supported platforms, including iOS and Android.

V-Play is voted as the best supported, most time-saving and easiest to learn cross-platform development tool in a recent _The Cross-Platform Tool Benchmarking 2014_ _research2guidance_ report. It offers a variety of plugins to monetize, analyze and engage users with native integrations for push notifications, in-app purchases and ad frameworks.

V-Play supports the following platforms:

- Android
- iOS
- UWP (Universal Windows Platform
- Desktop platforms like Windows, Linux and macOS
- Embedded devices and Raspberry Pi

The V-Play Apps implementation of PropertyCross uses the default native styles on iOS and Android. The styling can easily be adapted for other apps.
